## --- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---

> From a list of numbers seperated by a blank line for each segment, calculate which segment is the highest section. For example,

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```
> Consider this list is the input file, the fourth segment which is 7000 + 8000 + 9000 = 24000 is the highest segment out of all other segments

### Desclaimer
> This will not be the most optimal code as this is the first time i am writing a go code.
